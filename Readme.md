# Tokenized Rewards for Rating Video Tutorials

## Project Title
**Tokenized Rewards for Rating Video Tutorials**

## Project Description
The **Tokenized Rewards for Rating Video Tutorials** project allows users to rate video tutorials and receive tokenized rewards in return. Users can rate video tutorials on a scale from 1 to 5, and in return, they are rewarded with ERC20 tokens. The contract ensures that users can only rate a video once and that the ratings are stored on the blockchain for transparency. This incentivizes users to engage with the content while rewarding them for their participation.

## Contract Address
-0xc33002Be25b57792E441d8048B41d317CcfbbB03

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to foster engagement and improve the quality of online video tutorials by rewarding users for their ratings. By integrating blockchain-based token rewards, the platform provides a transparent, decentralized, and trustless mechanism to motivate users to participate in rating videos, helping both content creators and viewers. Over time, this model can be expanded to include features such as badges for top raters or staking to earn rewards.

## Key Features
- **Tokenized Rewards**: Users are rewarded with ERC20 tokens for rating videos.
- **One Rating Per User**: Each user can only rate a video once, ensuring fairness.
- **Transparent Rating System**: Ratings are stored on the blockchain, making them publicly auditable.
- **Rating Calculation**: Ratings are scaled from 1 to 5, and the reward is calculated based on the rating.
- **Average Rating**: A function is available to get the average rating for each video.
- **Incentivized Engagement**: Users are incentivized to engage with content by providing their feedback and receiving rewards.
- **ERC20 Token Integration**: The contract integrates with any ERC20 token for rewarding users.

## How It Works
1. **Rate a Video**: A user rates a video tutorial by providing a rating between 1 and 5.
2. **Reward Distribution**: Once the rating is submitted, the user is rewarded with a specified amount of ERC20 tokens (e.g., 1 token per rating point).
3. **Check Average Rating**: Anyone can view the average rating for a specific video by calling the `getAverageRating` function.
4. **View Previous Ratings**: Users can check if they have already rated a video using the `hasRated` function.

## Installation and Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher
- Node.js (for managing the project)
- A deployed ERC20 token contract (the address of which needs to be passed during contract deployment)

### Steps to Deploy
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-rating-contract.git
   cd video-rating-contract
